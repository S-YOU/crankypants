### The Cranky Manifesto

_Please bear with me as I flesh out this document over time._

**Single-user** by design.

**Compact and portable**: just one tiny executable. Minimal CPU and memory requirements.

**A server-rendered public-facing blog** for simple machine readability and SEO.

**A client-side browser app** for managing your node and interacting with your feed.
